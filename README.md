# surfs_up
## Overview
  Thr purpose of this project is to show to a potential business partner the wether patterns in Aahu, Hawaii. If the analysis proves that they are consistantly favorable he would like to open a surf and ice cream shop. In this final leg of the project we pulled date from June and December to represent two opposite times of the year that could show unfavorable weather. 
  
  ##Results
    With years worth of data showing the temperatures of these 2 two months we can determine there is not a very large fluctation in the temperatures between the two months that fall on opposite times of the year from each other in Oahu. We used the .describe() function to show averages of all the data to make it much more managable to see the overall picture. December is cooler all around. Average temp, high and low are all just a few degrees lower in December than June. The most drastic difference is that lows are cooler in December by the largest margin but looks promising for one to sell ice cream and surf equipment year round. particulary when assuming many visitors are visiting during the holiday season from much cooler places it is very reasonable to think they could be interested in ice cream and surfing.

  ##Summary
    Of course there are many factors to consider when deciding if one thinks a business will be successful in a particular place. For this we focused first on the weather. Precipitation if anything will be a larger factor than temperatures which are consistantly warm. More analysis of the weather could be done now that we have this data to work with. I would be interested in diving into other months data as well, the two we have used gives us a good idea but a further look could show helpful information. Our raw data has info from various weather stations, so chosing the best location based on weather at specif c station could be another worth while question. Although the island itself doesnt likely vary too much in its weather based on it's respective size.
